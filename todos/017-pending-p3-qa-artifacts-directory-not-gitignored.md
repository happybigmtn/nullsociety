# QA Artifacts Directory Not Gitignored

The `website/qa-artifacts/` directory appears in git status as untracked, suggesting it contains generated test/QA output that should be ignored.

## Problem Statement

The `website/qa-artifacts/` directory is showing as untracked in git status, indicating it likely contains generated QA/testing output that should not be version controlled.

**Current state:**
```bash
?? website/qa-artifacts/
```

## Findings

**Investigation:**
- Directory appears in `git status` as untracked
- Located in `website/` suggesting it's generated by web app tests
- Naming convention (`*-artifacts/`) suggests temporary output
- Similar to other runtime directories already in `.gitignore` like `data/`, `load-test-*/`

**Assumptions (need verification):**
- Contains screenshots, test reports, or QA output
- Generated by test runners or QA automation
- Should not be committed to repository

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Add to Root .gitignore

**Approach:** Add `website/qa-artifacts/` to root `.gitignore`

**Pros:**
- Simple, explicit path
- Works immediately

**Cons:**
- Only handles this specific directory
- Doesn't scale if other `*-artifacts/` directories appear

**Effort:** 1 minute

**Risk:** Low

### Option 2: Add Generic Pattern

**Approach:** Add `**/qa-artifacts/` or `**/*-artifacts/` to root `.gitignore`

**Pros:**
- Catches all QA artifact directories across the monorepo
- Future-proof

**Cons:**
- Might be too broad if some artifacts need tracking

**Effort:** 1 minute

**Risk:** Low

---

## Recommended Action

Add `website/qa-artifacts/` to root `.gitignore`.

Recommend Option 1 unless there's a pattern of multiple `*-artifacts/` directories.

## Technical Details

**Affected files:**
- `.gitignore` - add `website/qa-artifacts/` or `**/qa-artifacts/`

**Verification:**
```bash
# Verify directory is no longer tracked
git status | grep qa-artifacts
# Should return nothing after fix
```

## Resources

- Current `.gitignore` already has similar patterns: `data/`, `load-test-*/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `website/qa-artifacts/` pattern added to `.gitignore`
- [ ] `git status` no longer shows `website/qa-artifacts/`
- [ ] Directory can still be created by QA tools (not deleted, just ignored)

## Work Log

### 2025-12-31 - Completed

**Actions:**
- Added `website/qa-artifacts/` to root `.gitignore`

### 2025-12-31 - Initial Discovery

**By:** Claude Code (Code Review Agent)

**Actions:**
- Noticed `website/qa-artifacts/` in git status during review
- Inferred it's generated QA output based on naming
- Checked existing `.gitignore` patterns for similar cases

**Learnings:**
- Monorepo already has good patterns for ignoring generated directories
- This follows the same pattern as `data/`, `load-test-*/`

## Notes

- Low priority cleanup item
- Should be addressed before next release for cleanliness
- Need to verify what generates this directory (likely Playwright or Vitest)
